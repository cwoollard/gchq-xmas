This is the code behind my [Solving the GCHQ Christmas card post](http://matthewearl.github.io/2015/12/10/gchq-xmas-card/).

See the link for an explanation of the code.

To run the script you'll need to install `pycosat`.

Invoke with:

    ./gchq-xmas.py

The script should be adaptable to other [Nonogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram)
puzzles by modifying the variables at the top of the file.
